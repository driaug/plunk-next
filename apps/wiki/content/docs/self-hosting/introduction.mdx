title: Self-Hosting Introduction
description: Deploy Plunk on your own infrastructure
---

## Overview

Plunk is fully open-source and can be self-hosted on your own infrastructure. This gives you complete control over your data, email delivery, and infrastructure costs.

## Requirements

### System Requirements

- **Node.js**: Version 20 or higher
- **PostgreSQL**: Version 14 or higher
- **Redis**: Version 6 or higher
- **Docker** (recommended): For easy deployment

### AWS Services (Required)

- **AWS SES**: For email sending
- **AWS S3**: For asset storage (optional but recommended)

### Minimum Server Specs

- **CPU**: 2 cores
- **RAM**: 4GB
- **Storage**: 20GB (grows with contact data)

For scale (1M+ contacts):
- **CPU**: 4+ cores
- **RAM**: 8GB+
- **Storage**: 100GB+

## Architecture Components

### 1. API Server
Express.js application handling HTTP requests.

**Resources**: 1-2GB RAM, 1-2 CPU cores

### 2. Worker Process
BullMQ worker processing background jobs.

**Resources**: 1-2GB RAM, 1-2 CPU cores

**Important**: Run workers separately from API server for scalability.

### 3. Web Dashboard
Next.js application for the UI.

**Resources**: 512MB-1GB RAM

### 4. PostgreSQL Database
Stores all data (contacts, campaigns, workflows, etc.).

**Resources**: 2-4GB RAM, fast storage (SSD recommended)

### 5. Redis
Queue system for background jobs.

**Resources**: 512MB-1GB RAM

## Deployment Options

### Docker Compose (Recommended)

Easiest way to get started. Includes all services pre-configured.

[View Docker Guide](/self-hosting/docker)

### Kubernetes

For production deployments at scale.

### Manual Deployment

Deploy each component separately on your infrastructure.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository
2. Copy `.env.self-host.example` to `.env`
3. Configure environment variables
4. Run `docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.self-host.yml up -d`
5. Access dashboard at `http://localhost:3000`

## What's Included

- ✅ Full API server
- ✅ Worker process
- ✅ Web dashboard
- ✅ PostgreSQL database
- ✅ Redis queue
- ✅ All features (campaigns, workflows, segments)
- ✅ No feature limitations
- ✅ No phone-home telemetry

## What's Not Included

- ❌ Managed infrastructure
- ❌ Automatic updates
- ❌ Support (community only)
- ❌ SLA guarantees

## Cost Considerations

### AWS SES Costs

- First 62,000 emails/month: **FREE** (when sent from EC2)
- Additional emails: **$0.10 per 1,000 emails**

### Infrastructure Costs

Example for moderate usage:

- **Server**: $20-40/month (2-4GB RAM VPS)
- **Database**: $10-20/month (managed PostgreSQL) or included in VPS
- **Redis**: $5-10/month (managed Redis) or included in VPS
- **AWS SES**: $10-50/month (depends on volume)
- **AWS S3**: $1-5/month (asset storage)

**Total**: ~$50-100/month for self-hosting vs $99+/month for hosted version.

## Support

### Community Support
