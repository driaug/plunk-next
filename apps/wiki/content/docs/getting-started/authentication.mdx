## API Key Authentication

API keys are used for authenticating with the Plunk API. Each project has two types of API keys:

#### Public Key (pk_*)
- Used for client-side applications
- **Only works with the `/v1/track` endpoint** for tracking events
- Safe to expose in frontend code
- Cannot access any other endpoints

#### Secret Key (sk_*)
- Used for server-side applications
- **Required for all API endpoints** (contacts, templates, campaigns, `/v1/send`, etc.)
- **Never expose in client-side code**
- Should be stored securely as environment variables

## Using API Keys

### Getting Your API Keys

1. Log in to your Plunk dashboard
2. Navigate to your project settings
3. Find your API keys in the "API Keys" section
4. Copy your secret key (it's only shown once)

### Making Authenticated Requests

#### Using Secret Key (All Endpoints)

Provide your secret key using the `Authorization` header with Bearer token format:

```javascript
fetch('https://api.useplunk.com/v1/send', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer sk_your_secret_key_here',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    to: 'user@example.com',
    subject: 'Hello World',
    body: 'This is a test email'
  })
});
```

#### Using Public Key (Event Tracking Only)

The public key can **only** be used with the `/v1/track` endpoint for client-side event tracking:

```javascript
fetch('https://api.useplunk.com/v1/track', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer pk_your_public_key_here',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    email: 'user@example.com',
    event: 'button_clicked',
    data: { button: 'signup' }
  })
});
```

## Security Best Practices

### Keep Your Secret Keys Safe

- **Never commit secret keys to version control**
- Store them in environment variables
- Use secrets management services in production
- Rotate keys if they're compromised

```bash
# .env file
PLUNK_SECRET_KEY=sk_your_secret_key_here
```

```javascript
// In your code
const apiKey = process.env.PLUNK_SECRET_KEY;
```

### Use Public Keys Only for Event Tracking

If you need to track events from client-side code:

- Use public keys (pk_*) for the `/v1/track` endpoint only
- This is the only endpoint safe for client-side use
- **Never use secret keys in frontend code**
- For sending emails, always use server-side code with secret keys

### Regenerate Compromised Keys

If your secret key is compromised:

1. Go to your project settings
2. Click "Regenerate Keys"
3. Update all applications with the new key
4. The old key will be immediately revoked

## Testing Your Authentication

Test your API key with a simple request:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.useplunk.com/contacts?limit=5 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_your_secret_key_here"
```

If successful, you'll receive your contacts:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "items": [...],
    "hasMore": false,
    "total": 0
  }
}
```

## Common Errors

### 401 Unauthorized

- Check that your API key is correct
- Ensure you're using the Bearer token format
- Verify the key hasn't been regenerated

### 403 Forbidden

- Verify you have the correct role for the action
- Check that you're a member of the project
- Ensure you're using a secret key (not public) for protected endpoints

## Next Steps

Now that you're authenticated, you can:

- [Explore the API](/api-reference/overview)
- [Manage contacts](/guides/contacts)
- [Create campaigns](/guides/campaigns)
