## Welcome to Plunk

Plunk is a powerful, open-source email platform that helps you manage transactional emails, marketing campaigns, and automated workflows at scale.

## What can you do with Plunk?

### Transactional Emails
Send transactional emails like password resets, order confirmations, and notifications via a simple API. Plunk handles template rendering, variable substitution, and delivery tracking.

```javascript
// Send a transactional email
await fetch('https://api.useplunk.com/v1/send', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    to: 'user@example.com',
    subject: 'Welcome to our platform!',
    body: 'Hello {{name}}, welcome aboard!',
    subscribed: true,
    data: {
      name: 'John Doe'
    }
  })
});
```

### Marketing Campaigns
Create and send one-time email campaigns to your entire contact list or specific segments. Schedule campaigns for future delivery or send them immediately.

### Automated Workflows
Build sophisticated email automation with visual workflow builder. Create drip campaigns, onboarding sequences, and behavior-based emails that trigger based on user actions.

### Contact Management
Store and manage your contacts with custom fields. Import contacts from CSV files, segment them dynamically, and track their engagement.

## Architecture Overview

Plunk consists of several components:

### API Server
The Express.js-based API server handles all HTTP requests, including:
- Contact management
- Campaign creation and sending
- Workflow management
- Email template management
- Analytics and reporting

### Worker Process
A separate BullMQ worker process handles background jobs:
- Email sending with rate limiting
- Campaign batch processing
- CSV imports
- Workflow execution
- Segment computation
- Domain verification

### Database
PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM stores:
- Contacts and their data
- Email templates
- Campaigns and workflows
- Email tracking data
- User accounts and projects

### Queue System
Redis-backed BullMQ provides reliable job queuing with:
- Retry logic
- Rate limiting
- Job prioritization
- Concurrency control

### Email Delivery
AWS SES handles actual email delivery with:
- Domain verification (DKIM)
- Bounce and complaint handling
- Open and click tracking
- Delivery webhooks

## Core Concepts

### Projects
Projects are workspaces that contain all your contacts, templates, campaigns, and workflows. Each project has its own API keys and billing settings.

### Contacts
Contacts are individuals in your audience. Each contact has:
- Email address (required, unique per project)
- Subscribed status
- Custom data fields (JSON)
- Activity history

### Templates
Reusable email templates with variable substitution. Two types:
- **Transactional**: For API-triggered emails (no unsubscribe)
- **Marketing**: For campaigns and workflows (includes unsubscribe)

### Segments
Dynamic groups of contacts based on filters. Segments automatically update as contact data changes. Use segments to target specific audiences for campaigns.

### Campaigns
One-time email broadcasts sent to all contacts, a segment, or a filtered audience. Campaigns can be sent immediately or scheduled for future delivery.

### Workflows
Automated email sequences triggered by events or schedules. Workflows can include:
- Email sends
- Time delays
- Conditional branching
- Event waiting
- Contact updates
- Webhooks

### Events
Custom events tracked for contacts (e.g., "purchase", "login", "page_view"). Events can trigger workflows and be used in segment filters.

## Authentication

Plunk uses API keys for authentication:

Each project has two types of API keys:
- **Public Key** (pk_*): For client-side event tracking only (`/v1/track` endpoint)
- **Secret Key** (sk_*): For all other API endpoints (required for server-side usage)

## Rate Limits

To ensure fair usage and system stability:
- Email sending: 14 emails/second (AWS SES limit)
- API requests: Reasonable rate limits per endpoint
- Bulk operations: Automatically queued for background processing
