title: Custom Domains
description: Send emails from your own domain
---

## Overview

Custom domains allow you to send emails from your own domain (e.g., hello@yourdomain.com) instead of the default Plunk domain.

## Requirements

- Domain ownership
- DNS access
- AWS SES configured (for self-hosted)

## Adding a Domain

### Via Dashboard

1. Navigate to **Settings > Domains**
2. Click **Add Domain**
3. Enter your domain name
4. Follow DNS verification instructions

### Via API

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.useplunk.com/domains \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_your_secret_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "domain": "yourdomain.com"
  }'
```

## DNS Verification

After adding a domain, you'll receive DKIM tokens to add to your DNS:

```
Type: TXT
Name: _domainkey.yourdomain.com
Value: provided_by_plunk
```

Add these records to your DNS provider (Cloudflare, Route53, etc.)

## Verifying Domain

Plunk automatically checks verification status every 5 minutes.

Manual check:

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.useplunk.com/domains/domain_id/verify \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_your_secret_key" \
```

## Using Custom Domains

Once verified, specify the `from` field when sending:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.useplunk.com/v1/send \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_your_secret_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "to": "recipient@example.com",
    "from": "hello@yourdomain.com",
    "subject": "Hello from custom domain",
    "body": "Email content here"
  }'
```

## Managing Domains

### List Domains

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.useplunk.com/domains/project/project_id \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_your_secret_key"
```

### Remove Domain

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://api.useplunk.com/domains/domain_id \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_your_secret_key" \
```

## Troubleshooting

### Verification Failing

- Check DNS records are correct
- Wait for DNS propagation (up to 48 hours)
- Ensure no conflicting DKIM records

### Emails Not Sending

- Verify domain is verified
- Check AWS SES quotas (if self-hosted)
- Review sender reputation

## Best Practices

- Use subdomains for different email types (marketing.yourdomain.com, transactional.yourdomain.com)
- Maintain good sending practices
- Monitor bounce and complaint rates
- Warm up new domains gradually
