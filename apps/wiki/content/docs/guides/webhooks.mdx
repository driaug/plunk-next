description: Receive real-time notifications for email events
---

## Overview

Webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications when email events occur (deliveries, opens, clicks, bounces, complaints).

## Webhook Events

Plunk sends webhooks for:

- **delivery** - Email successfully delivered
- **open** - Email opened by recipient
- **click** - Link clicked in email
- **bounce** - Email bounced (hard or soft)
- **complaint** - Recipient marked as spam

## AWS SNS/SES Webhooks

Plunk uses AWS SES for email delivery and receives events via SNS:

### Endpoint

```
POST https://api.useplunk.com/webhooks/sns
```

### Configuration

1. Set up SNS topic in AWS
2. Subscribe to SES notifications
3. Configure SNS to send to Plunk webhook endpoint

## Stripe Webhooks

For billing events (if using hosted version):

### Endpoint

```
POST https://api.useplunk.com/webhooks/incoming/stripe
```

### Events Handled

- `checkout.session.completed` - Payment completed
- `invoice.paid` - Invoice paid
- `subscription.deleted` - Subscription cancelled

## Custom Webhook Steps

Use workflows to send webhooks to your own endpoints:

```json
{
  "type": "WEBHOOK",
  "config": {
    "url": "https://your-api.com/webhook",
    "method": "POST",
    "headers": {
      "Authorization": "Bearer your_token",
      "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    "body": {
      "email": "{{email}}",
      "event": "workflow_completed",
      "data": {
        "contactId": "{{id}}",
        "workflowName": "{{workflowName}}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Webhook Security

### Verify Signatures

Always verify webhook signatures to ensure requests are from Plunk.

### Use HTTPS

Only accept webhooks over HTTPS.

### Validate Payload

Check that the payload structure matches expectations.
