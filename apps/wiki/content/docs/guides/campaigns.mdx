  }
}
```

## Background Processing

Campaigns are sent asynchronously in batches:

1. Campaign is created with `DRAFT` status
2. When sent, status changes to `SENDING`
3. Contacts are queried based on audience type
4. Emails are queued in batches (1000 at a time)
5. Worker processes emails at 14/second (AWS SES limit)
6. Status changes to `SENT` when complete

## Best Practices

### 1. Test Before Sending

Always send a test email before sending to your entire list:

- Use the preview function in the dashboard
- Send to a test email address
- Check on multiple email clients (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail)
- Verify all variables are replaced correctly

### 2. Segment Your Audience

Don't send every campaign to everyone:

- Create targeted segments
- Personalize messaging based on segment
- Higher engagement = better deliverability

### 3. Timing Matters

Consider when your audience is most likely to engage:

- B2B: Tuesday-Thursday, 10am-2pm
- B2C: Evenings and weekends
- Test different times and analyze results

### 4. Monitor Deliverability

Watch your metrics:

- Open rate < 10%: Subject line or sender reputation issues
- Click rate < 1%: Content or CTA issues
- Bounce rate > 5%: List hygiene problems
- Complaint rate > 0.1%: Content or permission issues

### 5. A/B Testing

Test different elements:

- Subject lines
- Send times
- Content variations
- CTAs

Create multiple campaigns and compare results.

### 6. Clean Your List

Regularly remove:

- Hard bounces (immediately)
- Soft bounces (after 3-5 attempts)
- Unengaged contacts (no opens in 6 months)
- Unsubscribes (automatically handled)

### 7. Respect Unsubscribes

- Include unsubscribe link (automatic in marketing templates)
- Process unsubscribes immediately
- Never send marketing emails to unsubscribed contacts
- Respect preference center choices

## Example Campaign Workflow

```javascript
// 1. Create campaign
const createResponse = await fetch('https://api.useplunk.com/campaigns', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: 'Weekly Newsletter - March 15',
    type: 'SEGMENT',
    segmentId: 'active-users-segment',
    templateId: 'newsletter-template',
    subject: 'This Week in Product Updates',
    status: 'DRAFT'
  })
});

const campaign = await createResponse.json();

// 2. Schedule for tomorrow at 10am
await fetch(`https://api.useplunk.com/campaigns/${campaign.data.id}/send`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    scheduledAt: new Date(Date.now() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000).toISOString()
  })
});

// 3. Check status later
const statusResponse = await fetch(
  `https://api.useplunk.com/campaigns/${campaign.data.id}`,
  {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
    }
  }
);

// 4. Get stats after sending
const statsResponse = await fetch(
  `https://api.useplunk.com/campaigns/${campaign.data.id}/stats`,
  {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
    }
  }
);
```

## Troubleshooting

### Campaign stuck in SENDING

- Check worker process is running
- Check Redis queue is healthy
- Review worker logs for errors

### Low delivery rate

- Verify AWS SES is properly configured
- Check for domain verification
- Review bounce/complaint rates

### Low engagement

- Improve subject lines
- Segment your audience better
- A/B test different content
- Check send timing
