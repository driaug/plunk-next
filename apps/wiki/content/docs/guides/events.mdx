## Overview

Events allow you to track custom user actions and behavior. Use events to trigger workflows, segment audiences, and analyze user engagement.

## Tracking Events

### Via Public API

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.useplunk.com/v1/track \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_your_secret_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "event": "purchase",
    "data": {
      "product": "Premium Plan",
      "amount": 99.00,
      "currency": "USD"
    }
  }'
```

This will:
1. Upsert the contact with the email
2. Track the "purchase" event
3. Trigger any workflows listening for this event

### Via Events API

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.useplunk.com/events/track \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_your_secret_key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "contactId": "contact_id",
    "event": "page_view",
    "data": {
      "page": "/pricing",
      "source": "google"
    }
  }'
```

## Event Structure

Each event has:

- **event**: Event name (string)
- **contactId**: Associated contact
- **data**: Custom JSON data
- **createdAt**: Timestamp

## Common Event Types

### User Actions

- `user.signed_up` - New user registration
- `user.logged_in` - User login
- `user.updated_profile` - Profile update
- `user.deleted_account` - Account deletion

### Purchase Events

- `purchase` - Completed purchase
- `subscription.created` - New subscription
- `subscription.renewed` - Subscription renewal
- `subscription.cancelled` - Subscription cancellation

### Engagement Events

- `page_view` - Page visit
- `button_click` - Button interaction
- `video_watched` - Video engagement
- `file_downloaded` - File download

### Product Events

- `feature_used` - Feature usage
- `onboarding_completed` - Onboarding finish
- `trial_started` - Trial beginning
- `trial_ended` - Trial expiration

## Using Events

### Trigger Workflows

Create workflows that start when events occur:

```json
{
  "triggerType": "EVENT",
  "triggerConfig": {
    "eventName": "purchase"
  }
}
```

### Segment Audiences

Filter contacts by event activity:

```json
{
  "conditions": [
    {
      "field": "events.purchase",
      "operator": "exists",
      "value": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### Analytics

Analyze event trends over time via the analytics dashboard.

## Managing Events

### List Events

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.useplunk.com/events?limit=100" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_your_secret_key" \
```

### Get Event Names

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.useplunk.com/events/names \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_your_secret_key" \
```

### Get Contact Events

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.useplunk.com/events/contact/contact_id \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_your_secret_key" \
```

### Event Statistics

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.useplunk.com/events/stats \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_your_secret_key" \
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Consistent Naming

- Use lowercase with underscores: `user_signed_up`
- Be descriptive: `video_watched` not `vw`
- Group related events: `purchase.*`, `user.*`

### 2. Include Relevant Data

```json
{
  "event": "purchase",
  "data": {
    "product": "Premium Plan",
    "amount": 99.00,
    "currency": "USD",
    "paymentMethod": "credit_card"
  }
}
```

### 3. Track Key Milestones

Focus on events that indicate user intent or value:
- Sign ups
- Feature usage
- Purchases
- Engagement actions

### 4. Don't Over-Track

Avoid tracking every click. Focus on meaningful actions.
